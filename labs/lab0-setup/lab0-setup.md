1: Set up your device.
----
Depending on your hardware, follow the instructions provided in this directory: [Raspberry Pi 4](https://github.com/strubell/11-767/blob/main/labs/lab0-setup/setup-rpi4.md), [Jetson Nano](https://github.com/strubell/11-767/blob/main/labs/lab0-setup/setup-jetson.md), [Google Coral](https://github.com/strubell/11-767/blob/main/labs/lab0-setup/setup-coral.md). 
1. What device(s) are you setting up?
2. Did you run into any roadblocks following the instructions? What happened, and what did you do to fix the problem?
3. Are all group members now able to ssh in to the device from their laptops? If not, why not? How will this be resolved?

2: Collaboration / hardware management plan
----
4. What is your group's hardware management plan? For example: Where will the device(s) be stored throughout the semester? What will happen if a device needs physical restart or debugging? What will happen in the case of COVID lockdown?


3: Putting it all together
----
5. Now, you should be able to take a picture, record audio, run a basic computer vision model, and run a basic NLP model. Now, write a script that pipes I/O to models. For example, write a script that takes a picture then runs a detection model on that image, and/or write a script that . Include the script at the end of your lab report.
6. Describe what the script you wrote does (document it.) 
7. Did you have any trouble getting this running? If so, describe what difficulties you ran into, and how you tried to resolve them.
