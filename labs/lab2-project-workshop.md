Lab 2: Project Workshopping / Peer Feedback
===
The goal of this lab is for you to give and receive peer feedback on project outlines before writing up your proposal. Here's a reminder of what your completed project proposal should include:
- Motivation
- Hypotheses (key ideas)
- How you will test those hypotheses: datasets, ablations, and other experiments or analyses.
- Related work and baselines
- I/O: What are the inputs and output modalities? What existing tools will you use to convert device inputs (that are not a core part of your project) to a format readable by the model, and vice versa?
- Hardware, including any peripherals required, and reasoning for why that hardware is needed for this project. (This is where you will request additional hardware and/or peripherals for your project!)
- Will you need to perform training off-device? If so, do you need cloud compute credits (GCP or AWS), and how much?
- Potential challenges, and how you might adjust the project to adapt to those challenges.
- Potential extensions to the project.
- Potential ethical implications of the project.
- Timeline and milestones. (Tip: align with Thursday in-class labs!)

Read the feedback that the other groups gave on your proposal, and discuss as a group how you will integrate that into your proposal. List 3-5 useful pieces of feedback from your reviews that you will integrate into your proposal:
